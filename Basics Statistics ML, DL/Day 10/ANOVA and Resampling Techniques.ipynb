    "### 1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):\n",
    "- **Purpose:** ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if at least one group mean is statistically different from the others.\n",
    "- **One-Way ANOVA:** Examines the impact of a single factor on the dependent variable.\n",
    "    - **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** All group means are equal.\n",
    "    - **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** At least one group mean is different.\n",
    "- **Key Metric:**\n",
    "    - **F-statistic:** Ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance. A higher F-statistic suggests a significant difference among groups.\n",
    "    - **p-value:** Determines if the observed differences are statistically significant (commonly, p < 0.05).\n",
    "### 2. Resampling Techniques\n",
    "These methods improve model evaluation and reliability without relying heavily on assumptions about data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Resamples the data with replacement to generate multiple datasets.\n",
    "    - Useful for estimating the confidence interval of a statistic (e.g., mean, median).\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation (CV):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Splits the dataset into training and validation subsets multiple times to assess model performance.\n",
    "    - **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Divides data into K equally sized folds and trains the model K times, each time using one fold for validation and the remaining folds for training.\n",
